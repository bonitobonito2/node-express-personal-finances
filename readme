HOW TO USE APP CORECTLY:

1. send post request on yourPort/auth/registration, enter userName and password in body (craete account)

2. send post request on yourPort/auth/login, enter your userName and password, if everything is correct
   you will get your private jwt token, which u need to accses on protected routes.

3. create category, send POST request on yourPort/category/create. inser your token in request header (Bearer Token) because you need user account to create a category ,and in body insert data like this{"categoryName" : yourCategoryName}.

4. insert records in your category, use your token same as in last stap, and than POST youtPort/record/create, fill the body like this
   {"categoryName" : [],"description": , "price": , "type":"outcome", "process" :[Processing, Completed]}
   note : categoryName is not required and it should by array of categories, process key not required when type is income.

5. to get the created records. again insert your token and than post get request on the URL like this
   yourHost/record/filter?status=Completed&minPrice=500&maxPrice=1100&outcome=true, every query parameter is optional and you can add income=true too for example.
